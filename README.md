# PFS_Work_In_Progress

Collection of files and documents related to my work on 2D modeling of the point spread function in the PFS project.

- Code_Repository: collection of code. It is made out of:
	* Cluster_Code: code to analyze many images in an automatic manner on Princeton clusters
	* Older_Versions_Main_Code: few older notebooks of ``main'' code, i.e., analysis that I have been doing
	* Other_Noteboks: different notebooks to creat post-stamp images, determine illumination times and similar...

- Data: Collection of post stamp images 
	* CutsForTigerFeb5 - data taken with different lamps at LAM  during February, 2019
	* CutsForTigerMay2 - data taken with HgAr lamp at LAM on December 1.2 15, 2017 (cut created on May 2 2018)
