# PFS_Work_In_Progress

Collection of files and documents related to my work on 2D modeling of the point spread function in the PFS project.

1. Data: Collection of post stamp images 
- 1.1. CutsForTigerFeb5 - data taken with different lamps at LAM  during February, 2019
- 1.2. CutsForTigerMay2 - data taken with HgAr lamp at LAM on December 1.2 15, 2017 (cut created on May 2 2018)

2. Old Code: collection of outdated code

3. Cluster Code: Code to analyze many images in an automatic manner on Princeton clusters

6. Zernike.ipynb: (soon deprecated) complete script from May 2018 which can fit the data

7. Zernike_code.ipynb: (soon deprecated) code which is able to generate single images with comments and examples

8. Zernike_Module: (fluid)python module with definitions of functions - this implementation with module will eventually replace clumsy "Zernike.ipynb" where all definition are in the notebook itself

9. Zernike_Work: latest (fluid) jupyter notebook used to investigate the problem
